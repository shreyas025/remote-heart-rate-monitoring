# remote-heart-rate-monitoring
This project demonstrates a real-time heart rate monitoring system utilizing Eulerian Magnification techniques. The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces, and applies color magnification to extract subtle changes in facial color that correspond to heart rate variations.

## Features

- **Real-time Heart Rate Detection**: Uses Eulerian Magnification to detect subtle color changes associated with heartbeats.
- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in the webcam feed using `cvzone`.
- **Real-time Plotting**: Displays a real-time plot of heart rate data alongside the webcam feed.
- **Customizable Plot**: Includes grid lines, average BPM line, and adjustable time range on the plot.
